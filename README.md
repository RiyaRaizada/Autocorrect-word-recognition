# Autocorrect-word-recognition
It is a ML based project to accurately identify and correct misspelled word.
Two algorithms are used Jaccard Similarity and Edit distance.

Jaccard similarity is a measure of similarity between two sets. It is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sets.

Edit distance, also known as Levenshtein distance, measures how many single-character edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) are required to change one string into another.
